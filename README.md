# SPLand
Project Overview
This project is a memory management-focused C++ simulation that models and evaluates reconstruction strategies for war-affected settlements. Each plan follows a specific selection policy that dictates the order in which facilities are built. The simulation progresses in steps, where facilities are constructed over time, impacting the settlementâ€™s development.

Required Skills & Knowledge
To develop and understand this project, the following skills are necessary:

âœ” C++ Programming â€“ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), memory management, and data structures.
âœ” Rule of Five â€“ Proper handling of constructors, destructors, and copy/move semantics to manage dynamic memory.
âœ” Standard Data Structures â€“ Usage of std::vector, std::string, and std::map for efficient storage and retrieval.
âœ” Design Patterns â€“ Implementation of abstract classes and polymorphism for action and selection policies.
âœ” File Parsing â€“ Reading configuration files to initialize the simulation state.
âœ” Unix Development â€“ The project is tested on Unix-based systems and requires correct compilation using a Makefile.

Theoretical Concepts Used
ðŸ“Œ Memory Management in C++ â€“ Efficient allocation, deallocation, and avoiding memory leaks using Valgrind.
ðŸ“Œ Object-Oriented Design â€“ Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism for flexible simulation structure.
ðŸ“Œ Selection Strategies â€“ Implementing various decision policies for facility construction (e.g., naive, balanced, economic focus).
ðŸ“Œ Concurrency & State Management â€“ Handling multiple reconstruction plans operating in parallel.
ðŸ“Œ Simulation Flow Control â€“ Step-based execution where user commands affect how the simulation evolves.

This project showcases efficient C++ programming while emphasizing memory management, algorithmic decision-making, and simulation modeling.
